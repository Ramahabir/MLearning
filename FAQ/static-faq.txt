Q: How does temperature affect solar panel performance?
A: As solar panels heat up, their efficiency drops. Most panels lose about 0.4% to 0.5% of output per °C above 25°C. That means if the temperature hits 40°C, you could see a 6%–7% drop in power output — even if sunlight is strong. This is due to increased internal resistance and changes in semiconductor behavior inside the panel.

Q: What is irradiance and why does it matter?
A: Irradiance is the amount of sunlight hitting a surface, measured in watts per square meter (W/m²). More irradiance = more power. Clear midday skies often provide 800–1000 W/m². On cloudy or overcast days, this can fall to 100–300 W/m², drastically reducing output.

Q: Why is my predicted power low even though it’s sunny?
A: Even if it’s bright out, several things can limit output:
- High panel temperature
- Thin clouds or haze
- Soiling (dust, dirt, bird droppings)
- Shading from trees/buildings
- Panel tilt or orientation not optimal

Check your system's temperature and cleaning schedule. Also remember: the sun’s position matters — morning/evening sun isn’t as strong as noon sun.

Q: What does the predicted power value mean?
A: This is the estimated power (in kW) your system should be producing under current conditions — based on temperature and sunlight. It’s not total energy over time (that’s kWh), just the instantaneous output. It helps you know what to expect right now.

---

Q: How much power should I expect from my system?
A: It depends on system size and conditions. Here are rough examples for a 5 kW system:
- 1000 W/m² @ 25°C → ~4.8–5.0 kW
- 700 W/m² @ 35°C → ~3.2–3.8 kW
- 300 W/m² @ 20°C → ~1.0–1.5 kW

Output varies through the day and across seasons. No system hits 100% 24/7 — small losses are normal.

Q: How do clouds affect solar panel performance?
A: Clouds can drop irradiance dramatically. A fully overcast sky might reduce it by 70–90%. But surprisingly, partly cloudy days can cause short bursts of high output due to reflections — called the cloud edge effect.

---

Q: Why is my output suddenly lower than usual?
A: Check for:
- Dirty panels (dust, smog, pollen)
- Shading (new tree growth, neighbor's roof)
- Inverter issues (check error lights)
- Loose cables or corrosion
- High ambient temperatures

Also compare with weather data — low sunlight equals low power, even if it “looks” bright outside.

---

Q: Do I need to clean my panels?
A: Yes — dirt, dust, bird poop, or smog can cut output by 10–30%. Cleaning once every 3–6 months (or more if you’re in a dusty/polluted area) can keep your output stable. Use soft water and no harsh chemicals.

---

Q: What is the difference between kW and kWh?
A: kW (kilowatts) = power = how much energy you’re producing right now  
kWh (kilowatt-hours) = energy = how much you produced over time

Example:  
If your system produces 3kW for 2 hours → 3kW × 2h = 6 kWh

Q: What’s the ideal tilt and direction for panels?
A: North-facing (in southern hemisphere) or South-facing (in northern hemisphere) is ideal. Tilt should match your latitude for year-round output. For example, if you’re at 30° latitude, tilt the panel at ~30°. Panels that are too flat or too steep lose morning/evening or winter/summer output.
